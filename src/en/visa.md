At the moment there are still travel restrictions for foreign nationals into the
territory of the Republic of Indonesia. Those who are in the possession of a
valid Indonesian residence permit (KITAS / KITAP), or who have received an
Electronic Visa (E-Visa) for a Visit Visa (B211) or Temporary Stay Visa from the
Directorate General of Immigration in Jakarta, are allowed to enter the country.

Due to the covid-19 pandemic the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in The
Hague is not authorized to issue regular visas until the pandemic is declared
over. However, the Indonesian Embassy can issue a humanitarian/emergency visa
due to sickness/death of a family member in the first degree. For inquiries,
